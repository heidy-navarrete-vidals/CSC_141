# I will look at the python.org website and find something that interests me

""" I really like the success stories tab on the main page of the website. It shows how python has helped different subjects of education such as business, 
engineering and education. I was surpised to see that students in 5th and 6th grade are able to comprehend python and create wonderful programs to help 
them learn better in school.

There was also a community tab that contained many personal stories about people's experience with python and how it completely changed their lives.
Python has created an entire community for people to contribute to in the python.org website. I was even surprised to see that you can volunteer to help others
navigate through the site! """
