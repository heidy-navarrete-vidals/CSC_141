''' 
The only coding languages I know are HTML and CSS. I did a web design course in my junior year of high school but the course wasn't as advanced as I would 
have liked it to be. I think I have a higher interest in the artistic side of game development rather than the technical side but, the coding aspect 
is still cool. I had never thought about what I could make if I did have a lot of programming skills but I would match it with my interests in video games
that i enjoy playing which are usually in the horror genre. 

Pixel Art Video Game:
A narrative video game about the journeys of grief as an asolescent that aims to create awareness about some of the struggles that teenagers may go through 
as they grow older.

Personal Website:
Once I start creating projects throughout college I'd like to import them into an organized website similar to how Kaul includes all of the projects he has 
created in his career.

3D Horror Game:
A mutiplayer horror video game based around the ocean and discovering the unknown creatures that lie beneath. '''
